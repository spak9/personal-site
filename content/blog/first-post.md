# First Post

I was thinking for quite some time about what my first post was going to be about and just the general purpose of this "blog" section, but I figured that I stay true to what I wrote as my website's opening statement years ago

I don't want this blog to be a place where I coerce myself to write the utmost beautiful prose (although I wish it came naturally) and have the absolute wisest and best things to say. Generally, I think that would be mostly narcissistic on my part, thinking that I had great crowd flocking for my wisest of words and I'm already pretty full of myself, so hopefully those intentions wouldn't influence the way/what I write. Like I said earlier, I'm going to write about anything that inspires me to write, but I hope to write somewhat regularly so that I can map out my thoughts and actually have it down on paper rather than fumbling all kinds of things. First post done!
