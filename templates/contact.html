	<h1>Contact Me.</h1>
	<p>If you ever want to contact me, emailing me at <i>spak9 (at) gmu (dot) edu</i> is probably the
		quickest way to do so. I'm also on <i>LinkedIn</i>, but I don't use it often so making a 'connection' with me may not be that great. 
		I also check GitHub quite often, so that may be a good way to reach me as well.</p>
