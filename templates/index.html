<h1>Steven Pak.</h1>
<p>Hi there.
  <br>
  My name is Steven. I'm currently a mobile forensics software engineer at
  ManTech learning a lot about Android/iOS application security and obscure data serialization. I 
  also graduated with a B.S in Computer Science from George Mason University in
  2021.
  <br><br>
  I made this website not only for resume-sake,
  but also to record some of my thoughts regarding books
  or perhaps anything that inspires me to write. Although I've gone through iterations
  of this website dating back to 2021, I'm hoping to write more frequently as a means
  of examining my various projects and learnings, as well as to become a better
  writer and thinker.
